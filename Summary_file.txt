The industrial revolution, which began in the late 18th century, marked a significant turning point in human history. Before this period, most people lived in rural areas and worked in agriculture or small-scale industries. However, with the advent of new machinery and technological advancements, production processes became faster and more efficient. Factories emerged in urban centers, drawing large populations into cities in search of work. This shift led to the rapid growth of urban areas, changes in family structures, and the development of new social classes. While the industrial revolution brought about significant economic growth and increased the availability of goods, it also introduced several social and environmental challenges. Workers often faced harsh conditions, long hours, and low wages. Child labor was widespread, and housing in rapidly growing cities was frequently inadequate and unsanitary. Despite these issues, the era laid the groundwork for modern economic systems and spurred innovations that continue to shape our world today. The transformation also led to increased global trade and the expansion of empires, as industrialized nations sought new markets and resources. As a result, the industrial revolution is often seen as both a period of great progress and a time of profound upheaval.
